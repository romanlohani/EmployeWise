# Project Setup and Execution

This document outlines the steps required to install the necessary dependencies and run the React project.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js:** (Version 14 or higher is recommended) You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Node.js includes npm (Node Package Manager).
* **npm or yarn:** (yarn is optional, but if you prefer using it, install it globally using `npm install -g yarn`)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**

    If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository and `<project_directory>` with the name of the folder created.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run one of the following commands to install the project dependencies:

    **Using npm:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    **Using yarn:**

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    This command will read the `package.json` file and install all the required packages listed in the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections.

## Running the Application
